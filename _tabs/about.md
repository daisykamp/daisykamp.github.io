# Hi, I'm Daisy 👋

I’m a **Ph.D. student in Materials Engineering at UC Irvine** studying *heterogeneous catalysis and machine learning* for molecular simulations.

I serve as the **President of GradSWE @ UCI**, leading initiatives that support and empower graduate women in engineering.

## 🔬 Research Interests

- Machine learning potentials (GPyTorch, PyTorch)
- Ab initio molecular dynamics and DFT (VASP)
- Catalysis for plastic upcycling
- Energy landscape reconstruction

---

## 💡 Outreach & Leadership

As part of **GradSWE**, I organize research panels, mentoring programs, and outreach events to inspire future engineers.

> “Empowering women in STEM starts with visibility, mentorship, and collaboration.”
